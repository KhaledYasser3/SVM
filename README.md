# Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using Python. The notebook explores building an SVM model, visualizing the decision boundaries, and evaluating the performance of the classifier.

## Features
- Build an SVM classifier using scikit-learn
- Visualize decision boundaries
- Evaluate and analyze the model

## Requirements
Before running the notebook, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/svm-classifier.git
cd svm-classifier
```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook SVM.ipynb
```

3. Run the notebook cells to see the results and visualizations.
